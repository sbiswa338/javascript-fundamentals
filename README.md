# JavaScript Fundamentals

The fundamental lessons below are what I have been learning in this course so far. These lessons focus specifically on the Javascript language. This means that we are not using web technology. For our web lessons, we will use a different project. 
- All about Strings
- All about Numbers 
- Functions & Scope
- Operators 
- Conditional Statements 
- Looping Statements 
- Arrays
